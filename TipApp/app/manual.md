Welcome to the Tip Calculator app



- to use this app you must enter the total cost of your bill and the amount of participants you had involved with this bill
- by entering these numbers, you are sure to have non negative values, as well and positive values as the app will not work
- after entering such values in their respective location(towards the top of the screen), you will hit the calculate button which will then
    give you 6 values at the bottom with the varied amount of tip values
- these numbers are spread from 15,20 and 25 percent values as these are the most common
- the first row of values are what each individual party member would have to pay
- the bottom row is the total value of the bill
